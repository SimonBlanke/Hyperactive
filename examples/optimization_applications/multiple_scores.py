Hyperactive cannot handle multi objective optimization.
But we can achive something similar with a workaround.
The following example searches for the highest cv-score and the lowest training time.
It is possible by creating an objective/score from those two variables.
You can also return additional parameters to track the cv-score and training time separately.
